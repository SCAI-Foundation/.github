# SCAI

Welcome to SCAI, a decentralized academic service provider reshaping the entire academic research lifecycle through AI and Web3 technologies. We aim to provide researchers with:

- ❤️ Efficient and low-cost publishing pathways
- 🫴 Practical academic tools
- 📚 A scholar-governed ecosystem

SCAI currently has no tokens, but in the foreseeable future, we will build a DAO using token-based voting.

SCAI is still in its early development stage, and we welcome everyone who shares our vision to join us in building it.

## 🌍 Story

Scholars are a large and steadily growing group. As of 2025, the global number of higher education students is approximately 264 million. Among them, the total number of master’s and doctoral students worldwide is around 26.4–39.6 million.

Compared to other professions, scholars have unique needs. By 2025, the market for scholar services is valued at $32.1 billion. However, 90% of contributors receive no profits, while publishers dominate with profit margins as high as 35%–40%.

Even more astonishingly, unlike other service industries, publishing services lack competition in quality. Due to scholars’ reliance on publishing outcomes, their experience remains at a low level (e.g., lengthy review processes, page limits), completely failing to meet their actual needs.

Imagine if the profits from scholar services could be largely distributed to true contributors, including reviewers, editors, illustrators, and content auditors. With proper incentives, publishing efficiency and service quality could be accelerated, generating significant economic benefits.

AI and Web3 technologies make this vision possible. Through smart contracts and decentralized storage, we can dismantle the data moats built by publishers. With AI tools and frameworks, we can replace manual processes to efficiently review and manage literature, ultimately creating a scholar-governed, open academic publishing ecosystem.
