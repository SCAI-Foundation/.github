## The Origin Story
As many of you know, Sci-Hub has been a game-changer in the world of academic research, providing free access to countless scientific papers and empowering researchers worldwide. Inspired by this incredible contribution to open science, we launched $scihub, a meme token on Solana, to honor Sci-Hub’s legacy and bring it into the rapidly growing DeSci (Decentralized Science) movement.

On Nov 16, this journey took an exciting turn when 0xAA discovered $scihub and decided to make a difference. After acquiring 22% of the token supply, a significant portion (20%) was pledged to support Sci-Hub's founder, Alexandra Elbakyan, and sustain the platform that has helped millions of researchers globally.


## 🔥 What We Are Working On

- 🌐 Developing decentralized protocols and infrastructure
- 🧠 Researching blockchain governance mechanisms and tokenomics
